    <h3>My favorite hobby</h3>
    <p>My favorite hobby is gaming. I own at least 200 different game titles. I love being able to immerse myself into a games story and feel the same emotions that my character is supposed to feel.</p>
    <p>My favorite genres are horror, rpg, and 3d arena fighter.</p>
    <p>I especially love horror games. I love the feeling it when the game drops you into chaos and the only two options are fight or run</p>
